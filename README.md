Reproducible research has been on the radar of many of us for years
now. While most agree that reproducibility is a good features that we
should all strive for, it might at times appear that working
reproducibly is an additional difficutly in computational research and
data analysis, that come accross as an already difficult tasks for non
experts.

I will start by motivating my desire to work reproducibly:
increasing trust in my work, for myself and my readers.


There exists many solutions to support reprodcible research, some
rather simple and straightforward, and others that rely on more
complex software solutions.

I will them demonstrate some of the tools I develop and, more
importantly use on a daily basis, to promote reproducibility and
transparency in my work. These tools are developed in the frame of the
[R for Mass Spectrometry](https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/)
initiative
